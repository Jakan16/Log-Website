### Important msg form JÃ¸rn:  
> This is the CMS that I have been working on from 2014, it was the first thing called Sandsized (Sandsized-CMS),  
> which I would like to remain.  
> You(as in Sandsized Developer Team) are welcome to contribute and use this.  
> However the generel design of the structure has not yet been figured out, why the code, and the whole setup  
> it not perfect yet (Who knows if it ever will be xD).  
> Anyway I will try to migrate all the code from Github (The enemy) to the IMADA git server, this also includes the plugins that I have been writing.  
> As said there is still not a good interface between this Main-Core and the plugins.  
> There is also a problem with Database logins in clear text, why ALL repositories regarding this HAS TO BE PRIVATE!!!  
> Hopefully I will figure out something smarter which does not have the password in a file on the git-sever.  
> The domains sandsized.dk and sandsized.com will use this CMS, and I will make a reposetory for the specific website, since this is the Main-Core.
